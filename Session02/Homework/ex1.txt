1. A Boolean value is either true or false.
*For example:

>>> a = 5
>>> b = 6
>>> a == b 
False

>>> 1 == 2
False

>>> x = "Hello"
>>> x + "world" == "Hello world"
True

2. Flowchart is a type of diagram that represents an algorithm, workflow or process, showing the steps as boxes of various kinds, and their order by connecting them with arrows.


3. Nested conditionals mean that you can use one if or elif statement inside another if or else if statement(s).
*For example:
a = input("What's your username?")

while True:
	if a.upper() == "C4E":
		b = input("What's is your password?")
		if b == "codethechange"
			print("You're superuser")
		else:
			print("Your password is incorrect!")
	else:
		print("Not superuser")
